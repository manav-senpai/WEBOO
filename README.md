# ⚡ WEBOO — My Web Dev Journey

Welcome to **WEBOO** — my personal web dev playground, archive, and grind folder.  
This repo contains all my **daily practice**, **course exercises**, and **mini-projects** as I work my way through the full stack web dev path.

## 🚀 The Mission

I'm learning **Full Stack Web Development**, starting from zero and climbing up the stack — one `<div>` at a time.

Currently learning from:

- 👨‍🏫 **Code With Harry's Sigma Web Dev Course**
- 🧠 **Apna College Full Stack Bootcamp**
- 📚 Occasional help from **W3Schools**, **MDN**, and **ChatGPT**

Right now I'm focused on **CSS**, grinding through layouts, styling, and responsiveness.  
The idea is simple: **practice every day**, upload everything, track progress publicly (but in private 🫣).

## 🗂️ Repo Structure (for now...)


⚠️ **Note:**  
The repo is starting to get *crowded* with 100+ files already, so I'm planning to **restructure by months** soon:


Will handle that with Git once I dive deeper into version control. For now, brute force and vibes.

## ✅ What's Inside?

- Raw HTML/CSS/JS practice
- Solutions to course challenges
- Mini-projects from scratch
- Daily learning logs (sorta)

Everything here is self-solved. No copypasta. Just ✨progress✨.

## 💬 TL;DR  
**WEBOO** is my digital dojo.  
It’s where I track my journey, fail forward, and learn by doing.  
Full stack mastery — one file at a time.

Let’s go. 🚀
