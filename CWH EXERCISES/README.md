# 🧪 CWH EXERCISES

Welcome to the grind zone. This folder contains **Code With Harry’s Web Development Exercise Solutions**, solved by yours truly — **Manav**, no copy-paste bullshit. Just me, my keyboard, and a few mental breakdowns along the way. 🧠💻

## 🛠️ What's Inside
These are exercises from the legendary [Code With Harry - Sigma Web Dev Course](https://www.codewithharry.com/), solved manually as part of my frontend mastery arc.

Each day = a folder.  
Each folder = one more line of code closer to world domination.  
Every commit = a step closer to making my future website look like it was designed by a cyberpunk god.

## ⚙️ Folder Structure (more like vibe structure)

## 🤙 Notes
- No frameworks here. Just raw HTML, CSS, and JS — like a true web warrior starts with.
- Might look messy. That’s how growth begins. It'll age like fine wine 🍷
- Feel free to steal my code. But you can’t steal the pain behind each solution 💀

Enjoy the journey. Or don’t. I’m doing it anyway. 😤
